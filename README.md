# Note-Taker


## Description
* First I looked at the front end that was given to me, then I created my middleware folder and file before I started on the back-end. Then created routes folder to hold my back end files in. Finally I cleaned up some of the routes to between files to work properly and created a delete function to grab the id of whichever note user wants to delete, updating users daily note taker.
